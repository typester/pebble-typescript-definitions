# Typescript definitions for PebbleKit JS

No one no longer seems be interested this though...

## Usage

1. `git clone` or `submodule` or just copy this repository to your project dir.
2. Add the directory into `typeRoots` array in `tsconfig.json`
3. Also add `pebble` to `types` array in `tsconfig.json` for globally accessing to `Pebble` interface.

## Note

- Currently, only definitions that I'm using are defined.
- Patches welcome.
